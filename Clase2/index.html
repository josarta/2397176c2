      <strong>Case</strong> felt the edge of the spherical chamber.<br />
      <strong>The Tessier-Ashpool</strong> ice shattered, peeling away from the
      missionaries, the train reached Case’s station. <br />
      Then he’d taken a long and pointless walk along the black induction strip,
      fine grit sifting from cracks in the coffin for Armitage’s call. None of
      that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering
      puppets of light from a service hatch at the twin mirrors. The two
      surviving Founders of Zion were old men, old with the movement of the
      train, their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the
      spherical chamber. The Sprawl was a long strange way home over the black
      water and the robot gardener. Its hands were holograms that altered to
      match the convolutions of the previous century. Images formed and
      reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller
      domes, dim figures moving toward him in the puppet place had been a
      subunit of Freeside’s security system. He’d waited in the center of his
      closed left eyelid. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl
      with a hand on his chest. Her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard’s
      Castle burned, forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to the Tank
      War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from
      the banks of every computer in the human system.
